Revision history for Perl extension SNMP::BridgeQuery.

0.56  Changed namespace to SNMP::BridgeQuery

0.55  Added better error handling for devices that
      do not respond.  The hash it returns has a 
      single value (error => true) which can be tested 
      for.  Previously had problems with web pages 
      failing if BridgeQuery generated an error.  
      (This supercedes v0.53)

0.54  Changed arguments passed to BridgeQuery from
      list format to hash format.  Also added a 
      subroutine to do the connecting for all other 
      functions (&connect).  Community name now
      defaults to 'public' if none is specified.

0.53  Added some error checking for invalid IP, 
      community string or device does not support
      this function

0.52  Fixed problem where there was always one result
      that had a 'port' but no MAC address associated 

0.51  Added optional functions (querymacs & queryports)
      to just return 'MIB => MAC' or 'MIB => Port'

0.50  All the wonderful things that go into creating a
      module that led up to this 'original' version
